## Key Components:

1. **Single Neuron Class**: Basic building block with weights, bias, and activation function
2. **Simple Neural Network**: Exact implementation from your document (2 inputs, 2 hidden neurons, 1 output)
3. **Flexible Neural Network**: More advanced version that can handle multiple layers and different architectures

## Features:

- **Activation Functions**: Sigmoid and ReLU with their derivatives
- **Loss Functions**: Mean Squared Error and Binary Cross-entropy
- **Training**: Backpropagation with stochastic gradient descent
- **Initialization**: Xavier initialization for better convergence
- **Visualization**: Optional plotting of training loss

## The code includes:

1. **Mathematical foundations** - all the sigmoid functions, derivatives, and loss calculations
2. **Complete backpropagation** - step-by-step gradient calculation and weight updates
3. **Working example** - the gender prediction problem from your document
4. **Extended functionality** - flexible architecture for different network sizes

## Usage Examples:

The code demonstrates:
- Training on the gender prediction dataset (Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana)
- Making predictions on new data (Emily and Frank)
- Comparing simple vs flexible network architectures
- Visualizing training progress
